This project contains example data for a merger and aquisition scenario in the `data_room/` folder.  We focus on the `data_room/people` folder more closely.  Here, you will find the initial output of the instructor's AI in `people_headcount_app.py`.  The learner can optionally prompt their own IDE's AI to start iterating on style.

To run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run people_headcount_app.py
```

The app loads the roster from `data_room/people/employee_roster.csv`. Use the sidebar slider to set a target headcount and choose compensation prioritization.
